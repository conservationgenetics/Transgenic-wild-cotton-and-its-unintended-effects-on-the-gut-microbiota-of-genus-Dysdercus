Abstract

The interaction between plants, insects, and microbes (PIM) determines the assembly of natural and anthropic ecosystems. In agroecosystems, the relationships among PIM is based on the interacting taxa, the environmental conditions, and the agricultural management itself, including genetically modified (GM) organisms. Although evidence for unintended effects of GM plants on non-target insects is increasingly robust, our knowledge remains limited regarding their impact on gut microbes and their repercussions on the host's ecology and evolutionary history, especially in the wild. In this study, we compared the gut microbial community of Dysdercus bugs collected on wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plants, with and without insecticidal transgenes, in the center of origin and diversity of the host. Using data from 16S fragment amplification with Illumina MiSeq technology, we show differences in the structure and topology of the Dysdercus gut microbial network between specimens foraging wild cotton with transgenic introgression and without those. Specifically, we found significant changes in the degree, centrality of intermediation, and identity of nodes of importance among microbial co-occurrence networks. Identifying unintended effects of genetic engineering in natural ecosystems will provide first-line knowledge for informed decision-making to manage genetic, ecological, and evolutionary resources. Thus, determining which organisms interact with GM plants and how is the first step toward the conservation of natural ecosystems with evidence of transgenic introgression.
